<img src="media/myprofile.png" alt="Profile Page" class="comparison top">
<p>Favorite Run's user profile page displays all information from your campaigns and logged runs. After each logged run, a user's distance, time, and calories burned are added to that user's lifetime totals. The graph below the totals shows how many runs of each type the user has logged, with the exact number below. The profile page also contains personal records for farthest run (distance), fastest pace, longest run (time), and calories burned. Overall, the profile page presents data tracked by Favorite Run in a fun and easily digestable layout.</p>

<img src="media/loggingrun.png" alt="Logging your run" class="comparison top">
<p>After completing a run, the user is prompted to save their run if they so chose. Saving the run will add data from the run to the user's profile stats, as well as the entire run to their run history. Users can select one of the smiley faces to indicate how they felt after their run, along with adding a note and/or a photo. Favorite Run is also integrated with Apple Health, so if a user choose to, they can export their data from the run into Apple Health.</p>

<img src="media/payment.png" alt="Payment" class="comparison top">
<p>Some running campaigns are paid campaigns because they award physical prizes. When users join a paid campaign, they are prompted to first select a prize package. Once a prize package is selected, users input their payment information. The payment collection was included as the last step in the process as studies have shown that users are more likely to complete the transaction if they can see the value (prizes) first.</p>
<p>
To make it easier for users, we incorporated both card scanning and Apple Pay, as well as the traditional form. For those who chose to fill out the form, the label for the selected field moves up and shrinks when the input field becomes active. This allows the user to maintain a frame of reference for the selected input field.
