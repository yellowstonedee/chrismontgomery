<h4>TEXT POET</h4>
<h5>Wireframes, Information Architecture, UI Design</h5>

<p>Text Poet is an app developed to work within the iOS 10 keyboard. It allows users to create and send frequently used responses. Users have the ability to share their responses to the community and download what others have shared. Users can also create a custom emoji which can then be sent via text message. The goal of Text Poet is faster, more eloquent text messages.

<h6 class="title">THE WORK</h6>

<p>
	Text Poet posed a unique challenge in that it is built to work on the iOS 10 keyboard. At the time, this was new and uncharted territory for us. We had to really familiarize ourselves with a different design space than what we were used to. 

	One of the harder parts in design was having the ability to create a large number of responses while still being able to find the appropriate response quickly. We solved that problem by introducing groups and tags for responses. While in the keyboard, users have the ability to smart search for strings of text. Search results include both groups and tags containing that text string.
