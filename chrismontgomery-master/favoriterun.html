<h4>FAVORITE RUN</h4>
<h5>Wireframes, Interface Design, Icon Design, Admin Wireframes</h5>


<p>Favorite Run is challenge based run tracking app. Users can create or join community challenge campaigns or simply run for themselves. A challenge campaign gathers users together to run for a common goal; either miles ran, calories burned, or total participants. Certain campaigns will have sponsors, who will donate a dollar amount to a specified charity for certain milestones (eg. $10 for every 100 miles ran). 
</p>

<h6 class="title">THE WORK</h6>	
<p>
	The trickiest part of design was setting Favorite Run apart from all of the other running apps. Favorite Run is targeted towards people who don't normally run, but are willing to run to support a cause. One thing we wanted to stress with the design was the fun aspect of running. The app uses a bright color scheme and whimsical illustrations and animations to delight users. To get users to return to the app, we added inspirational messages and awarded medals for completing runs. 
	<br />
	The other challenge was getting the admin panel to sync to the front facing mobile side. The admin needs the ability to create campaigns, add prizes, setup sponsorships and charities, distribute money, etc. The sheer amount of things the admin can do made creating a clear and easy to use backend a very complex task.

<p>Favorite Run's user profile page displays all information from your campaigns and logged runs. After each logged run, a user's distance, time, and calories burned are added to that user's lifetime totals. The graph below the totals shows how many runs of each type the user has logged, with the exact number below. The profile page also contains personal records for farthest run (distance), fastest pace, longest run (time), and calories burned. Overall, the profile page presents data tracked by Favorite Run in a fun and easily digestible layout.</p>

<p>After completing a run, the user is prompted to save their run if they so chose. Saving the run will add data from the run to the user's profile stats, as well as the entire run to their run history. Users can select one of the smiley faces to indicate how they felt after their run, along with adding a note and/or a photo. Favorite Run is also integrated with Apple Health, so if a user choose to, they can export their data from the run into Apple Health.</p>

<img src="media/payment.png" alt="Payment" class="comparison top">
<p>Some running campaigns are paid campaigns because they award physical prizes. When users join a paid campaign, they are prompted to first select a prize package. Once a prize package is selected, users input their payment information. The payment collection was included as the last step in the process as studies have shown that users are more likely to complete the transaction if they can see the value (prizes) first.</p>
<p>
To make it easier for users, we incorporated both card scanning and Apple Pay, as well as the traditional form. For those who chose to fill out the form, the label for the selected field moves up and shrinks when the input field becomes active. This allows the user to maintain a frame of reference for the selected input field.
