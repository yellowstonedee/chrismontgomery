<h4>BURGER KING</h4>
<h5>Wireframes, Information Architecture, Loading Animation Design</h5>

<p>Burger King Latin America serves over 30 countries in Central and South America. With the app, users can view menu items and nutritional information, find and get directions to nearby Burger King restaurants, and view/use available coupons. 
</p>
<h6 class="title">THE WORK</h6>
<p>
Burger King posed a unique challenge due to the region that the app is handling. One of the biggest problems we faced during design and development was dealing with the three language options available; English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Due to the difference in word lengths between the languages (menu, menú, cardápio), each screen had be designed to accommodate varying word lengths while still maintaining the same look. 
</p>

<p>The other major obstacle was issues with poor cell reception and limited wifi in the region. Upon testing, we found that users were unable to download all of the new coupons at once each time the app was opened. To remedy this, only the latest six coupons would load upon app opening. It wasn't until the user chose to see more that the app would load the next six coupons on the screen.

<h6 class="title">ADMIN PANEL</h6>

<p>Burger King Latin America also needed a back end panel for creating coupons, updating information, and adding new restaurants. The admin panel was designed for use by one or more appointed Burger King representatives for each country. From the admin panel, the country rep has the ability to create coupons and specify which restaurants the coupon will apply to. Admins also have the ability to create and schedule push notifications as well as receiving statistics on the success of the push notifications.
</p>

<p>Similar to the app, the admin panel needed to be designed in a way that allowed for all three languages to be easily displayed without any design changes between them. The panel also needed to be easily navigable, as admins won't necessarily be the most tech savvy. Clear call to actions and forms with simple labels help the admins do what they need to do.

<h6 class="title">SUPER ADMIN PANEL</h6>
<p>In addition to the country based admins, a Super Admin oversees the entire region. The Super Admin has the ability to assign representatives to countries and assign a default language for that country (users have the option to change to their preferred language). Super Admins can also see metrics relating to the app (total downloads, total users, user retention rate, etc...). </p>
