<h4>BOOTCAMP GROUPIE</h4>
<h5>Information Architecture, Navigation Update, UI Re-Design</h5>

<p>
	Bootcamp Groupie is a fitness app where users join short workout programs called bootcamps. During these bootcamps, users are given a daily workout and meal plan to follow. Weekly check ins allow users to track their progress by updating their weight, measurements, and body pictures. Unlike many other workout program apps, users join bootcamps with others to help encourage each other to keep going and meet their goals.
</p>

<h6 class="title">THE WORK</h6>
<p>
	Bootcamp Groupie launched and was having some fundamental issues when it came to user experience and navigation, as well as an outdated and lackluster design. I was brought on to re-imagine and re-design the layout as well as the look and feel. My first step was to re-design the overall navigation. Users were having a hard time finding out when they needed to take an action.  Users are required to take many actions at different times during the day, so having these call to actions hidden behind a menu was detrimental to user retention. I decided to use a tab bar navigation because it is easier for users to get where they need to go. This also allowed each section to have its own call to action that was easily visible at all times.

<p>There were many menu items in the old navigation design that did not warrant their own option. For example, in the hamburger menu everything is weighted to be of the same importance, when in reality that is not the case. We want the user to click on 'My Bootcamp' more than they click on 'Options' or 'My Contacts'. A tab bar navigation allowed for more emphasis to be placed on specific sections where user action is required. Overall, the main goal of the navigation re-design was to consolidate all of the actionable items into one clear spot.

<h6 class="title">Old Open Bootcamp Feed vs New Open Bootcamp Feed</h6>
<figure>
<img src="media/Feed.png" alt="Feed" class="comparison">
<p>This is the first screen a user sees after completing the sign up process. Since the hamburger menu was changed, I was able to move the 'Create Bootcamp' button into the top left, as the main focus of the page should be viewing and joining available bootcamps. The old design did not have any way for users to search for a specific bootcamp, so for the new design I added an always visible search bar. Notifications was moved from being its own menu option to being on the feed as this is the first page a user sees when opening the app.
<br><br>
The main design issue on this page was having the text overlaid on the bootcamp's cover image. Bootcamp creators have full control over their bootcamp's cover image, so the overlaid text didn't look good all the time. This hurt the overall look of the main page. Sometimes it would look great, other times it would look cheap and terrible. Users were also reporting having trouble reading the text on some images due to low contrast. By moving the text to its own container, the text will always be consistent and readable no matter the image uploaded.

<h6 class="title">Old Weekly Check in vs New Weekly Check in</h6>
<figure>
<img src="media/weeklycheckin.png" alt="Weekly Check In" class="comparison">
<p>Every week, users are required to complete a weekly check in list. Users need to log their weight, measurements, take new body pictures, and go shopping for the upcoming week. The old design had several issues with user completion. The first issue with the old design was when and where the prompt to complete came. The weekly check in reminder would pop up at the bottom of the original hamburger menu. If a user happened to notice and click the prompt, they would be stuck until they completed all of the steps. The first three steps could be completed relatively easily. However the shopping caused users and developers problems. What if a user didn't want to go shopping that day? What if the user never purchased the previous week's items? Users were held hostage until this last step was completed. Another large problem with getting users to complete this weekly check in was the look of the buttons for the four steps. The buttons look like check boxes and users were confused when they tapped and were taken to another page. </p>
<p>We solved all of these issues by placing the check in at the top of the 'My Bootcamp' screen, removing the requirement to go shopping and pre-populating the shopping list automatically, and changing the look of the buttons. </p>
